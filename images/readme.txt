This folder contains circuit diagrams required for preliminary setup in laboratory assignments.
Each simulation-based lab starts with a schematic assembly stage, where students are expected to analyze and construct the specified electrical circuit before proceeding with the experiment.
The folder includes two versions of the same schematic diagram: one in Ukrainian and one in English, to support multilingual instruction.
